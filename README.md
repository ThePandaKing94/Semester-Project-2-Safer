# Semester-Project-2-Safer
I would like to add that I was unable to update the repository and I therefore have only created this repository in case I would fail.


!BE NOTED!
Due to the format changes between word and PDF files, I realize that the text would look weird. Just be noted this, it is possible to change it. But I cannot do that myself considering I don't know what format is being used to open it.
